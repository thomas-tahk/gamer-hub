<h1>Persona</h1>

<h2>Name:</h2>
<p>Mick Muller</p>
<hr>
<h2>Technology</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Devices:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Has a laptop running Windows 11 and uses Google Chrome as his browser of choice. He doesn't know the exact specs but it's good enough to join online lobbies/sessions with his friends.</li>
    <li>Has iphone model from 2 years ago and is comfortable with it for basic phone functions and for browsing, which he defaults to with Safari</li>
    <li>Owns a Nintendo Switch for some casual and party games</li>
</ul>
<h3>Loves/Hates:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Loves gaming as a group activity with friends or in friendly social situations.</li>
    <li>Finds some of his friends' enthusiasm for gaming infectious, but he tends to be one of the early ones to bed if a session starts going late into the night</li>
    <li>Hates being too competitive or feeling under-prepared in a room full of experienced players</li>
    <li>Hates the similar things that his friends do. If my friends are unhappy with whatever, I'm unhappy about it with them. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Proficiency:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Mick is not the most tech-savvy, but doesn't mean he's completely clueless.</li>
    <li>Mick is a relatively casual user who can figure his way around most apps he uses just for the express purposes of his own use. Don't test him on it though.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Attitudes and Behaviors:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Mick finds it easy to at least start conversations and make small talk with just about anyone.</li>
    <li>He tends to be happy when everyone else (he cares about) is happy.</li>
    <li>If he were to categorize himself as a gamer, it would be casual-core. He casually plays all the games his friends play hardcore and has fun just laughing off whatever happens.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Frustrations/Needs:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Needs more venues/options for social game nights with friends/family</li>
    <li>Frustrated by lack of centralized information about locations and events for the kinds of games he and his friends want to play</li>
</ul>
<h3>Goals:</h3>
<p>Mick wants more games (especially if it's interesting ones he never heard about before) and more places/opportunities to play those games with friends and any friendly strangers with similar interests.</p>

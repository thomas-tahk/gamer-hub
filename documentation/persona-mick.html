<body>
<h1>Persona</h1>
<hr>
<h2>Name:</h2>
<p>Mick Muller</p>
<hr>
<h3>Devices:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Has a laptop running Windows 11 and uses Google Chrome as his browser of choice. He doesn't know the exact specs but it's good enough to join online lobbies/sessions with his friends.</li>
    <li>Has iphone model from 2 years ago and is comfortable with it for basic phone functions and for browsing, which he defaults to with Safari</li>
    <li>Owns a Nintendo Switch for some casual and party games</li>
</ul>
<h3>Loves/Hates:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Loves gaming as a group activity with friends or in friendly social situations.</li>
    <li>Finds some of his friends' enthusiasm for gaming infectious, but he tends to be one of the early ones to bed if a session starts going late into the night</li>
    <li>Hates being too competitive or feeling under-prepared in a room full of experienced players</li>
    <li>Hates the similar things that his friends do. If my friends are unhappy with whatever, I'm unhappy about it with them. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Proficiency:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Mick is not the most tech-savvy, but doesn't mean he's completely clueless.</li>
    <li>Mick is a relatively casual user who can figure his way around most apps he uses just for the express purposes of his own use. Don't test him on it though.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Attitudes and Behaviors:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Mick finds it easy to at least start conversations and make small talk with just about anyone.</li>
    <li>He tends to be happy when everyone else (he cares about) is happy.</li>
    <li>If he were to categorize himself as a gamer, it would be casual-core. He casually plays all the games his friends play hardcore and has fun just laughing off whatever happens.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Frustrations/Needs:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Needs more venues/options for social game nights with friends/family</li>
    <li>Frustrated by lack of centralized information about games, locations, and events for the kinds of games he and his friends want to play</li>
</ul>
<h3>Goals:</h3>
<p>Mick wants more games (especially if it's interesting ones he never heard about before) and more places/opportunities to play those games with friends and any friendly strangers with similar interests.</p>
<h3>User Story:</h3>
<p>As a player, I want to quickly figure out whether this app can lead me to the kind of games, venues, and other players I would like to see.</p>
<h3>Use Case:</h3>
<p>Mick's friend Brett tells him about a new app called A Game Away he's on to find new games and meetups for board games. Brett wants Mick to join him in the next game he's hosting on Saturday afternoon. Mick is onboard and is also curious about the new app as well. But first, time to join Brett's game. </p>
<ul>
    <li>Pre-Condition: Mick has received a link to the app called A Game Away from Brett in his DMs and/or email and is at the home page.</li>
    <li>Post-Condition: Mick is signed up on the app and has joined Brett's game on Saturday.</li>
</ul>

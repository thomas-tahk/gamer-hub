<h1>Persona</h1>
<hr>
<h2>Name:</h2>
<p>Mick Muller</p>
<hr>
<h2>Technology</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Devices:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Has a laptop running Windows 11 and uses Google Chrome as his browser of choice. He doesn't know the exact specs but it's good enough to join online lobbies/sessions with his friends.</li>
    <li>Has iphone model from 2 years ago and is comfortable with it for basic phone functions and for browsing, which he defaults to with Safari</li>
    <li>Owns a Nintendo Switch for some casual and party games</li>
</ul>
<h3>Loves/Hates:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Loves gaming as a group activity with friends or in friendly social situations.</li>
    <li>Finds some of his friends' enthusiasm for gaming infectious, but he tends to be one of the early ones to bed if a session starts going late into the night</li>
    <li>Hates being too competitive or feeling under-prepared in a room full of experienced players</li>
    <li>Hates the similar things that his friends do. If my friends are unhappy with whatever, I'm unhappy about it with them. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Proficiency:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Mick is not the most tech-savvy, but doesn't mean he's completely clueless.</li>
    <li>Mick is a relatively casual user who can figure his way around most apps he uses just for the express purposes of his own use. Don't test him on it though.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Attitudes and Behaviors:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Mick finds it easy to at least start conversations and make small talk with just about anyone.</li>
    <li>He tends to be happy when everyone else (he cares about) is happy.</li>
    <li>If he were to categorize himself as a gamer, it would be casual-core. He casually plays all the games his friends play hardcore and has fun just laughing off whatever happens.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Frustrations/Needs:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Needs more venues/options for social game nights with friends/family</li>
    <li>Frustrated by lack of centralized information about locations and events for the kinds of games he and his friends want to play</li>
</ul>
<h3>Goals:</h3>
<p>Mick wants more games (especially if it's interesting ones he never heard about before) and more places/opportunities to play those games with friends and any friendly strangers with similar interests.</p>
<h3>User Story:</h3>
<p>As a player, I want to quickly figure out whether this app can lead me to the kind of games, venues, and other players I would like to see.</p>
<h3>Use Case:</h3>
<p>Mick's friend Brett tells him about a new app he's on to find new games and meetups for board games. Brett wants Mick to join him in the next game he's hosting on Saturday afternoon. Mick is onboard and is also curious about the new app as well. But first, time to join Brett's game. </p>
<ul>
    <li>Pre-Condition: Mick has received an invitation link from Brett in his DMs and/or email.</li>
    <li>Post-Condition: Timmy finds a new channel he really likes, which he then follows to add to his list of Following channels.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>Interaction-Flow</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Timmy briefly looks for the channel Brett mentioned on the first few sections of front page including the carousel at the top and 'Live channels we think you'll like'</li>
    <li>Timmy looks for the channel by name by typing into the search bar at the very top</li>
    <li>A few letters into typing in the search bar, Timmy sees the channel he was looking for at the very top of the drown down suggestions. He clicks it.</li>
    <li>Timmy is taken to the channel. He notices that the channel is live and takes a little time to check out the presentation and content of the channel.</li>
    <li>Timmy decides he would like to return to this channel regularly, so he looks for and clicks the heart icon to the right of the channel name right below the channel window.</li>
    <li>Timmy is now following the channel. He looks to the list of 'Followed Channels' on the menu to the left under the section labeled 'For You' to confirm the channel is listed before he returns to enjoying his content.</li>
</ul>

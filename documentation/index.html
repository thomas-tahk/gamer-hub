<h2>Summary:</h2>
    <p>
        In our first two-week sprint, we navigated challenges in selecting an external database/API, ultimately opting for the XML API from BGG.com. We also made a key project decision to remove the 'groups' entity and features due to redundancy with 'sessions' and the added complexity it introduced.</p>
    <p>
        Our workflow has taken shape, with each team member independently developing ideas and outputs before collaboratively refining and integrating them. As a result, we've successfully created three user personas, nearly 14 wireframes (excluding group-related pages), an entity relationship diagram, and finalized our external data source. With these foundations in place, weâ€™re looking ahead to the next sprint.

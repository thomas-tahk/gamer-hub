    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>
        I'm Ezekiel Grado, a licensed electrician serving the Albuquerque, NM area.  I'm passionate about two things: keeping the lights on and exploring the latest in technology and gaming.  I believe in staying ahead of the curve, whether it's the newest smart home technology or the hottest new board game release.  When I'm not on a job or immersed in the tech world, you'll likely find me at a local game night, strategizing over a complex Eurogame or exploring a cooperative adventure. I love the community aspect of gaming and enjoy sharing my passion with others.

    <h3>My Tech Journey</h3>
    <p>My tech journey began with tinkering – taking apart old electronics and trying to put them back together (sometimes successfully!). That curiosity led me to build my first gaming PC in high school, and I've been hooked on both hardware and software ever since.  I'm fascinated by the power of technology to create immersive experiences, from the realism of VR games to the intricate simulations of smart home systems. I also enjoy dabbling in game development, exploring the creative side of technology.</p>

    <h4>User story</h4>
    <p> By using Agameaway.com I want to axcess local places to play physical board game with my friends and meet new like minded people</p>
    <h5>User Flow</h5>
    <ul>
        <li> I'm trying to go to new venues and spots to meet like minded people. I go on to agameaway.com because it was local to my area. I open up my laptop and access the internet.</li>
        <li> When I log on to the website the login pops up and i exit out cause I dont like to share my information. I click on the game data page and view a board game I like on game data page and see there is alot of people in the area that are interested in the same game by activity counter that shows up linking public and private accounts into a group that are playing the same game in different locations. I have been wanting to impress my friends and I came up with an idea.</li>
        <li>I told them all to type in web page information and try to make a social group but the site doesn't let us access the social hub without logging in. So we all agree and create a single group account for everyone. I make a social profile by adding a username and email and make the account public by filling out a sign up form and verify my e-mail now we get access to all venues and were we can play latest board games on hub and message one another.</li>
        <li>We all get through venue Thomas contacts us through group chat that he can't make it but his friends that he had invited requested to join the groupchat cause they didn't know where we were since the profile is public and they already have existing accounts they find me by searching for local groups. I accepted join request and we start chatting with each other. They make it and we keep score on website and some cool animation happens when scores are input.</li>
        <li> We all logged off and saved group for later reunions</li>
    </ul>

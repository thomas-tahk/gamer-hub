        <h3>Use Case</h3>
        <p>Agnes and her friends were hanging out and talking about wanting to find new games to play with more people.
            They agreed that plenty of sources already had a way to find new games, but wished there was a more convenient way to choose a game to play,
            and find people nearby to play it with. Agnes decided to look for a website that could help her discover games
            and create a group to help people interested in the same games  meet up at local venues.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pre-Condition: Agnes is logged into her account and on the "groups" page.</li>
            <li>Post-Condition: Agnes creates a new group with its own description and preferences that allows new members to join.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

            <li>The site directs her to the “groups” page</li>
            <li>Agnes is able to see and join pre-existing groups, as well as an option to make a new group, which she clicks on</li>
            <li>Site redirects her to group creation page (or UI popup)</li>
            <li>Agnes enters all relevant information (name of group, groups goals, member cap, location, interests, preferences) and clicks submit</li>

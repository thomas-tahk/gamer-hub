    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>
        I'm Ezekiel Grado, a licensed electrician serving the Albuquerque, NM area.  I'm passionate about two things: keeping the lights on and exploring the latest in technology and gaming.  I believe in staying ahead of the curve, whether it's the newest smart home technology or the hottest new board game release.  When I'm not on a job or immersed in the tech world, you'll likely find me at a local game night, strategizing over a complex Eurogame or exploring a cooperative adventure. I love the community aspect of gaming and enjoy sharing my passion with others.

    <h3>My Tech Journey</h3>
    <p>My tech journey began with tinkering – taking apart old electronics and trying to put them back together (sometimes successfully!). That curiosity led me to build my first gaming PC in high school, and I've been hooked on both hardware and software ever since.  I'm fascinated by the power of technology to create immersive experiences, from the realism of VR games to the intricate simulations of smart home systems. I also enjoy dabbling in game development, exploring the creative side of technology.</p>
